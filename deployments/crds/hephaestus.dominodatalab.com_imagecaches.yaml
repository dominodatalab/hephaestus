              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

                        NOTE: this field was previously used to assert the presence of an auth entry inside of secret credentials. if the

                         several `registryAuth` items with the same secret if they want to verify the presence. in a future api version,
                         we may remove the Server field from this type and replace it with one or more fields that service the needs all
                         credential types.
